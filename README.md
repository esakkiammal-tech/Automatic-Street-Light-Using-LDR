**Automatic Street Light Using LDR**
**Description**
This project implements an automatic street light system using an LDR sensor and Arduino. The light automatically turns ON during night and turns OFF during daytime based on surrounding light conditions.

**Components Used**

Arduino UNO

LDR Sensor

LED

Resistor

Breadboard

Jumper Wires

**Working**

Daytime → LDR senses light → LED remains OFF

Nighttime → LDR senses darkness → LED turns ON

**Applications**

Street lighting systems

Energy saving systems

Smart city projects

Automatic lighting control
