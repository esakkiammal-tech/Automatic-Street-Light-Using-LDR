# Automatic-Street-Light-Using-LDR
The Automatic Street Light Using LDR project uses an Arduino and an LDR sensor to control a street light automatically. The light turns ON during night and OFF during daytime based on surrounding light conditions. This system helps save energy and reduces manual operation.
